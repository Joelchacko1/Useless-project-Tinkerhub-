Not So Friendly Chatbot

Team Name: Capricorn
Team Members: Joel Joy
Project Description
Welcome to Not So Friendly Chatbot—a quirky conversational bot designed to engage users with a mix of humor and sass. While it may not always be friendly, it brings a unique flavor to automated chats, making interactions both entertaining and slightly unpredictable.

The Problem
In a world where friendly chatbots dominate, the problem that never existed was the lack of sarcastic and witty bots to keep conversations lively. People were never really asking for a chatbot that could roast them while providing answers to their questions.

Solution
Introducing the Not So Friendly Chatbot—a solution nobody specifically requested! By combining humor with responsiveness, it engages users in unexpected ways, challenging the status quo of conventional chatbots.
