## Project Description
Welcome to **Not So Friendly Chatbot**—a quirky conversational bot designed to engage users with a mix of humor and sass. While it may not always be friendly, it brings a unique flavor to automated chats, making interactions both entertaining and slightly unpredictable.

## The Problem
In a world where friendly chatbots dominate, the problem that never existed was the lack of sarcastic and witty bots to keep conversations lively. People were never really asking for a chatbot that could roast them while providing answers to their questions.

## Solution
Introducing the **Not So Friendly Chatbot**—a solution nobody specifically requested! By combining humor with responsiveness, it engages users in unexpected ways, challenging the status quo of conventional chatbots.

## Technology Used
1. **Languages**: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
2. **Framework**: Flask
3. **Libraries Used**:
   - Flask (for the backend server)
   - Random (for generating dynamic responses)
   - JSON (for data exchange between client and server)
4. **Tools Used**:
   - Visual Studio Code (for development)
   - Git (for version control)
   - Browser (for testing the web application)
