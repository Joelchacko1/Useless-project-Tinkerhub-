## Project Description
Welcome to **Not So Friendly Chatbot**—a quirky conversational bot designed to engage users with a mix of humor and sass. While it may not always be friendly, it brings a unique flavor to automated chats, making interactions both entertaining and slightly unpredictable.

## The Problem
In a world where friendly chatbots dominate, the problem that never existed was the lack of roasting and witty bots to keep conversations lively. People were never really asking for a chatbot that could roast them while not providing answers to their questions and unnesscary not related answers

## Solution
Introducing the **Not So Friendly Chatbot**—a solution nobody specifically requested! By combining roasting with a nonresponsiveness, it engages users in unexpected ways, challenging the status quo of conventional chatbots.

## Technology Used
1. **Languages**: Python, HTML
2. **Framework**: Flask
3. **Libraries Used**:
   - Flask (for the backend server)
   - Random (for generating dynamic responses)
   - JSON (for data exchange between client and server)
4. **Tools Used**:
   - Replit.Ai (for development)
   - Browser (for testing the web application)

## Implementation

### Installation on Replit
To get started with the **Not So Friendly Chatbot** on Replit, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Replit project and select **Python** as the template.

2. In the Replit editor, create the following files:
   - `app.py` (for the backend)
   - `index.html` (for the frontend)

3. Copy and paste the provided code into their respective files:
   - Paste the backend Flask code into `app.py`.
   - Paste the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code into `index.html`.

4. Install the required package by adding 'pip install Flask' on shell


### Running the Application
To run the application, click on the **Run** button at the top of the Replit interface. This will start the Flask server.

You can access the chatbot interface by clicking on the **Open in a new tab** button, or by navigating to the provided URL in your web browser.
